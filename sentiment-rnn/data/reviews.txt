REPUBLIKACOID JAKARTA  Director of PT Sawit Sumbermas Sarana Tbk SSMS Syafril Harahap said the opening of palm oil exports by the government had a positive impact on the companys export sales of crude palm oil CPO Especially in taking advantage of the CPO price moment As an oil palm plantation company according to Syafril SSMS always supports government policies SSMS continues to maximize sales by channeling most of its CPO to PT Citra Borneo Utama CBU Supply from other parties said Syafril in a press release Wednesday 2262022 This way continued Syafril the CPO produced by SSMS is sold to PT CBU to be processed into CPO derivative products That way when exports are reopened for palm derivative products the company is more optimistic about the operational and financial performance of SSMS SSMS said Syafril is also exploring selling options to buyers in order to maximize sales This is because the export faucet was closed by the government In order to accelerate the p  target sales SSMS opens the option to increase sales to third parties to address the CPO tank Currently according to Syafril SSMS opens more sales options to third parties to accelerate sales and increase profits Since the export faucet was closed by the government in May 2022 SSMS has continued to produce as usual the Company even continues to buy palm fruit from farmers at a reasonable market price However he said since June 15 2022 SSMS began to limit the purchase of FFB from third suppliers because SSMSs CPO storage tanks calculated in the next 3 weeks had already exceeded capacity However all SSMS PKS are still operating to produce core FFB and purchase FFB from plasma farmers said Syafril Syafril estimates that in the near future by prioritizing sales to third parties the SSMS CPO tank will return to normal a lot of CPO from third-party suppliers came back he said
Jakarta ANTARA The ban on exports of crude palm oil CPO and cooking oil has had a multiple negative impact not only on palm oil business actors but also on three 3 million oil palm farmers in Indonesia In addition Indonesias macroeconomic performance is threatened due to a decline in foreign exchange exports so that it can be a factor that depresses the exchange rate of the rupiah against the US dollar Director of the Center of Economic and Law Studies Celios Bhima Yudhistira reminded that the government must immediately lift the ban on CPO exports Because the policy has more negative impacts instead it can be a strategy to control cooking oil prices The excess supply of palm oil which has been absorbed in the export market is unlikely to be absorbed in the domestic market Immediately lift the ban said Bhima in Jakarta Friday He said one of the real impacts of the export ban policy was a decrease in the price of FFB fresh fruit bunches for oil palm farmers Another negative impact the low absorption of CPO due to the export ban has depressed FFB prices In fact a number of palm oil mills in the near future will find it difficult to receive FFB from farmers because the CPO storage tanks are starting to fill up From field observations the decline in the price of palm oil FFB occurred in almost all regions after the ban on exports of CPO and its derivative products two weeks ago In South Sumatra farmers FFB prices fell by around Rp 500 per kilogram In Riau the drop in FFB prices reached Rp1000 per kilogram to around Rp2900 per kilogram The decline in FFB prices also occurred in other central areas of oil palm plantations such as Jambi Kalimantan and Sulawesi The export ban policy is not effective in ensuring the stability of cooking oil prices because the problem of cooking oil is actually a distribution issue not raw materials said Bhima In addition to having a negative impact on oil palm farmers Indonesias macroeconomic performance is also threatened In 2021 the contribution of foreign exchange for palm oil exports will reach US35 billion or more than Rp500 trillion and palm oil will become the largest contributor to foreign exchange exports Apart from export foreign exchange palm oil exports also contribute to the state treasury in the form of export taxes export duties and income from export levies This decline in palm oil export earnings has the potential to suppress the trade balance surplus and threaten the stability of the rupiah exchange rate against the US dollar \With the price of CPO in the international market being very high while in the domestic market it is low due to oversupply it will trigger smuggling This will make the dynamics of the national palm oil industry even more complicated and complicated said Bhima Meanwhile Prof Petro Paganini a commodity expert from John Cabot University in Rome Italy said that amid the global shortage of vegetable oil due to the war between Russia and Ukraine the world had no other choice but to look for palm oil Even in European countries various food companies have started using palm oil as a raw material and some food products in Europe have removed the \palm oil free label \It is inevitable that the world needs palm oil Moreover if the world is concerned with sustainability issues the choice is to develop palm oil because oil palm plantations are much more productive than other vegetable oil crops said Pietro in a discussion with stakeholders of the Indonesian palm oil industry in Jakarta Wednesday 11052020
The Malaysian Derivatives Exchange released an increase in the price of crude palm oil CPO by 067 percent to the Malaysian ringgit MYR position of 2119ton Most likely this increase will continue from trading to 2105ton The strengthening of the prices of Indonesia and Malaysias leading agricultural commodities reached an increase after the good news from New Delhi India The good news includes tariff cuts on crude palm oil imports Moreover they have already decided on agreements with countries in Southeast Asia India raised import duties on palm oil to 44 percent from the previous figure of only 30 percent Meanwhile their import duty on refined oil rose from 40 percent to 55 percent With this policy investors are excited to buy This is because the lower the import duty the higher the profit As is known India is the country with the largest import of crude palm oil in the world with a total importer of 544 million tons That number mostly comes from Indonesia While from Malaysia the figure is only 198 million tons Then positive sentiment also emerged from its rival namely soybean oil As of this afternoon soybean oil prices have traded as much as 12302 lots at a volume of 25 tonslot This number increased from yesterdays trading volume which was only 7163 lots However this increase was slightly hampered by the strengthening of the Malaysian Ringgit against the greenback As of 15:50 WIB the ringgit has appreciated by 036 percent against the dollar Just to note the value of the ringgit currency in the Malaysian stock exchange is strengthening which will have an impact on increasing the price of oil derived from palm oil This makes the demand for processed palm oil slightly eroded
JAKARTA investorid Research & Development ICDX Girta Yoga said that negative sentiment still looms over the movement of CPO prices this week However there is still potential for this bearish trend to reverse if it gets a positive catalyst in the market namely Indonesia which will start the B40 biodiesel trial program in July Yoga explained that the negative sentiment will come from the release of Malaysian CPO export data in June This will describe the demand from the importing country In addition the demand trend will also depend on the export policies of the main producing countries namely Indonesia and Malaysia especially regarding the export tax that will be imposed In addition import duty policies from major importing countries such as India will also have an impact on the pace of global CPO demand said Yoga to Investor Daily recently However Yoga emphasized that there is still potential for this bearish trend to reverse if it gets a positive catalyst in the market namely Indonesia which will start a B40 biodiesel trial program in July This is because this will have an impact on the supply of Indonesian CPO to the global CPO market In addition so far the soybean oil market is still likely to have a positive impact on the movement of soybean oil prices These include the threat of hot weather in the US and the spike in fertilizer prices triggered by the Ukraine conflict Yoga added As a result continued Yoga the movement of CPO at the end of next week will likely still be in the same range this weekend With a potential resistance level in the price range of 5250 5500 Malaysian Ringgit per ton If it gets a negative catalyst the price has the potential to fall towards the support level in the price range of 4750 4500 Malaysian Ringgit per tonne he concluded
KONTANCOID JAKARTA The movement of crude palm oil CPO prices which tend to rise will still bring positive sentiment for CPO issuers this year The persistent geopolitical tensions between Russia and Ukraine have also raised vegetable oil prices so that they also support CPO prices tons If the selling price of CPO is above RM 5000 CPO issuers have made a big profit said Head of Investment Reswara Gian Investa Kiswoyo Adi Joe to Kontancoid Thursday 214 He observed that in the second half of 2022 which enters the harvest season CPO prices will tend to fall Even so palm oil producers can still reap profits because the production costs are relatively low compared to the selling price of CPO In addition geopolitical tensions between Russia and Ukraine will also affect CPO price movements Kiswoyo is of the opinion that if this tension continues and disrupts the supply of corn and donkeys it is likely that the price of CPO will not fall significantly Meanwhile Head of Investment Research at Infovesta Utama Wawan Hendrayana explained that the movement of CPO issuers stock prices cannot be separated from the influence of CPO prices Given the relatively high price it is estimated that the income of palm oil issuers will be higher than last year Although the income of CPO issuers is facing pressure from rising energy prices inflation and taxes Wawan believes that it will not affect the companys revenue too deeply Compared to last year revenue and sales will continue to increase especially for companies that carry out exports So far this year is more positive than last year At least maybe this years growth is 15 to 20 percent assuming CPO prices are like the current situation which is still rising unless suddenly CPO prices decline said Wawan Meanwhile Wawan recommended PT Astra Agro Lestari Tbk AALI shares to be observed He assessed that the shares of listed companies in the Astra group have attractive prospects because they have quite a large export activity

JAKARTA The European Union will find it difficult to get raw materials to replace crude palm oil or Crude Palm Oil CPO if they continue to carry out a black campaign The prohibition or barriers to CPO in the European Union will actually trigger inflation for countries in Europe We are still subject to negative campaigns in European countries Europeans understand very well that it is impossible for them not to consume palm oil both technically and non-technically Europe will experience high inflation if it does not use palm oil Palm productivity is 9 times higher than soybeans he said Deputy Minister of Trade Bayu Krisnamurthi when met at the Office of the Ministry of Trade on Jalan Ridwan Rais Jakarta Friday 21032014 Bayu explained that Indonesias CPO exports to Europe are quite large In fact Indonesia is the main supplier of European CPO needs Every year on average Indonesias CPO exports to Europe reach 35 million tons while Europes CPO needs reach 63 million tons Indonesia is the largest supplier to Europe he added He asked the European Union to eliminate the black campaign against Indonesian palm oil The reason is that Indonesia is the largest producer of certified environmentally friendly and sustainable palm oil in the world RSPO  Of the 82 million tons of palm oil that are certified sustainable in the world 48 million tons of them are produced in Indonesia So Indonesia is the largest producer of certified sustainable palm oil in the world he explained
